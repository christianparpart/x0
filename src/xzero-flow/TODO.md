### incomplete TODO

All the things I've found out on the way, that need retouching

- [ ] TargetCodeGenerator: `stack_` vs `sp_` vs `variables_`
- [ ] nested scopes with local variables must be initialized in this block
      currently also initialized in entry block;
      the problem is already how the AST is created.
