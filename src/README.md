Flow Engine Rewrite
===================

IDEAS
-----

1. Handlers may invoke others, but may not recurse.
2. Thus, we do not need a stack, as every variable symbol directly maps onto one storage location.
3. We can map the AST onto an array of opcodes and invoke these instead.
4. Every handler invokation inside a handler is inlined.
5. Allow serializing VM programs in binary form to disk, to be reloaded later.

PROCEDURE
---------

1. source code gets parsed into an AST
2. the AST gets transformed into an IR (SSA form)
3. run optimization passes on that IR
4. generate VM program
