Xzero is a thin low-latency and scalable HTTP web server and web service framework
written in modern C++.

## Framework Features

- Thin and clean core API
- Response output filter API
- HTTP/1.1, including pipelining
- Flexible configuration language, Flow
- fully asynchronous response content generation support
- zero-copy networking optimization through sendfile() system call
- transmitting of static files with partial response support and cache-friendly

# x0d HTTP Application Gateway Server

`x0d` is the dedicated HTTP web server that is built ontop of the
Xzero Framework.

It supports a very expressive and natural configuration language and
a number of standard plugins to become *your* web application gateway.

### x0d Features

- Customizable Error Pages
- Automatic Directory Indexing
- on-the-fly executable upgrade with gracefully finishing currently active requests.
- Easily Extensible via the Powerful Plugin System
- SSL connection encryption
  - SSL Server Name Indication (SNI) extension
- Dynamic Content Compression
- Advanced Dynamic Load Balancer
  - Supporting different backend transports (TCP/IP, and UNIX Domain Sockets).
  - Supporting different backend protocols (HTTP and FastCGI)
  - Advanced Health Monitoring
  - JSON API for retrieving state, stats,
    and reconfiguring clusters (including adding/updating/removing backends).
  - [Client Side Routing support](http://xzero.io/#/article/client-side-routing)
  - Sticky Offline Mode
  - X-Sendfile support, full static file transmission acceleration
  - HAproxy compatible CSV output
  - Object Cache
    - fully runtime configurable
    - client-cache aware
    - life JSON stats
    - supports serving stale objects when no backend is available
    - `Vary` response-header Support.
    - multiple update strategies (locked, shadowed)
- Basic Authentication
  - including PAM authentication
- Request Path Aliasing
- Automatic Directory Listing
- Apache-style access logging
- User-directory Support
- Browser Match Support
- Customizable Expires & Cache-Control Response Header Control
- instant mode (configuration-less basic HTTP serving)
- CGI/1.1 Support

### Building from Source on Ubuntu 14.04:

    # Installs required dependencies
    sudo apt-get install make cmake gcc-4.8 g++-4.8 libgnutls28-dev libgcrypt11-dev \
        libmysqlclient-dev libev-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev pkg-config \
        libpcre3-dev libfcgi-dev libgoogle-perftools-dev libtbb-dev libpam-dev git
    
    # If you want to built the tests, you must install libgtest-dev and then built it yourself
    sudo apt-get install libgtest-dev
    cd /usr/src/gtest && sudo cmake . && sudo make && sudo cp -vpi libgtest*.a /usr/local/lib/; cd -
    
    # Install git and clone repository
    git clone git://github.com/xzero/x0.git && cd x0
    
    # Now run cmake to bootstrap the build
    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=debug -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/local
    
    # Ensure installation target prefix
    mkdir $HOME/local
    
    # Now compiling should just work.
    make && make install
    
    # Run web server on port 8080
    `pwd`/x0d/src/x0d --instant=`pwd`/www/htdocs,8080
    
    # or try its CLI help
    `pwd`/x0d/src/x0d -h

    # have fun hacking and don't forget to checkout the just installed man pages ;-)
